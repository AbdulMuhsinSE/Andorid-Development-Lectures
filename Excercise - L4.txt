Build an app that does the following:
1. Invokes another activity, sends a message to that activity and shows it on the other activity.
2. Can invoke the camera app.
3. Implements resource use and proper resource destruction.
4. Can be terminated through a button.
Use the code that has been uploaded in MainActivity.java.html as a guide if you have a problem.
(Note the code provided does not explicitly cover all of the above, but should contain enough information to
help solve the problem.)
